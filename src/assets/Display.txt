Sure! Here's a detailed explanation of each `display` property value in CSS:

### 1. `block`
- **Description**: The element is displayed as a block-level element. It takes up the full width available and starts on a new line, effectively pushing any following content to a new line.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for structural elements like `<div>`, `<p>`, and `<h1>`, where you want the element to span the full width of its container and stack vertically.

### 2. `inline`
- **Description**: The element is displayed as an inline element. It does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as its content requires. It flows within the text.
- **Use Cases**: Suitable for elements like `<span>` and `<a>`, where you want the element to flow within a line of text without causing line breaks.

### 3. `inline-block`
- **Description**: The element is displayed as an inline-level block container. It does not start on a new line, allowing multiple elements to sit next to each other, but supports setting width and height.
- **Use Cases**: Useful for elements that need to be inline with others but also require fixed dimensions, such as buttons or image containers.

### 4. `none`
- **Description**: The element is not displayed at all; it is removed from the document flow and does not occupy any space.
- **Use Cases**: Typically used to hide elements dynamically with JavaScript or CSS without removing them from the DOM.

### 5. `flex`
- **Description**: The element is displayed as a flex container, allowing for flexible and responsive layouts with flexible item sizing and alignment.
- **Use Cases**: Perfect for creating responsive layouts where elements need to align and distribute space dynamically within a container.

### 6. `grid`
- **Description**: The element is displayed as a grid container, enabling complex grid-based layouts with rows and columns.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for creating intricate layouts with precise control over rows and columns, such as dashboards or complex web layouts.

### 7. `list-item`
- **Description**: The element is displayed as a list item, which typically includes a marker (such as a bullet or number) and is used in lists.
- **Use Cases**: Used for list items in ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered lists (`<ul>`), where each item should be styled as a list entry.

### 8. `table`
- **Description**: The element is displayed as a block-level table container, similar to HTML table elements. It allows for table-like layouts.
- **Use Cases**: Useful for creating table-like structures with CSS, without using actual `<table>`, `<tr>`, or `<td>` elements.

### 9. `table-row`
- **Description**: The element is displayed as a table row, used within a table structure to group table cells.
- **Use Cases**: Used within a table container to group table cells (`<td>`) into rows, mimicking the behavior of the `<tr>` element.

### 10. `table-cell`
- **Description**: The element is displayed as a table cell, used within a table row to contain table data.
- **Use Cases**: Used within a table row to create cells that hold content, similar to the `<td>` element in HTML tables.

Each `display` property value allows you to control how an element is rendered and how it interacts with surrounding elements, making it a fundamental aspect of layout design in CSS.
