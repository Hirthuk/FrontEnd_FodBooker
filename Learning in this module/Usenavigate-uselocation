`useNavigate` and `useLocation` are two important hooks provided by **React Router** that allow you to manage navigation and access route-related information in your React applications.

### 1. `useNavigate`:
`useNavigate` is used for programmatic navigation in your React application. It allows you to redirect or navigate the user to another route without using `<Link>` or `<a>` elements.

#### How It Works:
- When you call `useNavigate()`, it returns a function (`navigate`) that you can use to navigate to a different route within your application.
- This function can be used to:
  - Redirect the user to a new route.
  - Pass additional data (state) to the target route.
  - Replace the current route (instead of pushing to the history stack).

#### Basic Example:
```javascript
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function ExampleComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  function handleClick() {
    // Navigate to "/about" page
    navigate('/about');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to About Page</button>
  );
}
```

#### With State:
You can also pass **state** along with navigation, which will be available on the new route.

```javascript
function handleClick() {
  navigate('/about', { state: { message: 'Hello, About Page!' } });
}
```

### 2. `useLocation`:
`useLocation` is used to access the current route's location information, such as the pathname, search parameters (query string), hash, and any state that was passed when navigating to this route.

#### How It Works:
- When you call `useLocation()`, it returns an object representing the current location of the app. This object includes:
  - `pathname`: The current URL path.
  - `search`: Query parameters in the URL.
  - `hash`: The fragment identifier in the URL.
  - `state`: Any state data that was passed during navigation.

#### Basic Example:
```javascript
import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

function ExampleComponent() {
  const location = useLocation();

  console.log(location.pathname); // Current path, e.g., '/home'
  console.log(location.state);    // State passed during navigation, e.g., { message: 'Hello' }

  return <div>Current path: {location.pathname}</div>;
}
```

### Use Case Together:

In your scenario, you are using both `useNavigate` and `useLocation` to pass data from one component to another.

#### Example Flow:
1. **Using `useNavigate`:** In `MainComponent`, you navigate to the `/Shop` route programmatically and pass the shop details as state.

```javascript
function dishdatasent(shopDetails) {
  navigate('/Shop', { state: { shopDetails } });
}
```

2. **Using `useLocation`:** In the `Shop` component, you retrieve the `shopDetails` from the state using `useLocation`.

```javascript
const location = useLocation();
const { shopDetails } = location.state;  // Retrieve the shop details
```

This allows you to pass and access data between routes seamlessly without the need to manage global state or URL parameters.

### Summary:
- **`useNavigate`**: Lets you navigate programmatically and pass state to the target route.
- **`useLocation`**: Lets you access the current location's information, including state that was passed when navigating.

Together, they help create a smooth experience for passing data and controlling navigation in your React Router-based application.
